# Workshop: Image Data Augmentation

Welcome to the Image Data Augmentation workshop! Feel free to work ahead following the directions in this readme document.

## Prerequisites

Please create accounts (if you do not already have them) on the following sites:

* [Edge Impulse](https://www.edgeimpulse.com/) (to train machine learning models)
* [Google Gmail](https://gmail.com/) (for use with Google Colab)

## 1: Examine Old Model

Navigate to the following project: [https://studio.edgeimpulse.com/public/36514/latest](https://studio.edgeimpulse.com/public/36514/latest)

Take a look at the training and test datasets in *Data acquisition*. How many samples are there per class? Do you think this is enough to create a robust model?

Go to *Impulse design > NN Classifier*. Take a look at the model: it is the default convolutional neural network (CNN) used by Edge Impulse for image classification.
